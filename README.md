# Image-Recognition-without-using-Neural-Network
After working on a end year project for University, showcasing the better energetic efficiency of Neuromorphic comparing two programms, I've decided to improve my second algorithm. You'll find 3 files of codes : the main programm, the calculation of its accuracy and the test on the MNIST data-base.


The first file PictureRecognition.py is the main program. It contains all the classes required to recognize an image. It is independent to the two other files. I suggest you read carefuly the notes at the beginning.

The two other files are using the MNIST data-base, stored in CSV files. Accuracy.py uses Image_Recognition_MNIST.py in order to calculate the accuracy for a set of datas, but it is also independent from the used Data Base. Finally, Image_Recognition_MNIST.py is there in order to open the necessary files containing the MNIST set.
